# how to play cribbage

## quick scoring guide

### pegging

  - play a card that brings the total to fifteen (fifteen): peg 2
  - play a card of the same rank as the previously played card (pair): peg 2
  - play a card of the same rank as the last two cards played (triplet): peg 6
  - play a card of the same rank as the last three cards played (four/double pair/double pair royal): peg 12
  - play a sequence / run (see below) with length GE 3: peg the same number of points as the number of cards in the sequence (e.g. sequence of 3 peg 3, sequence of 4 peg 4)

  A run is a series of cards whose ranks can be re-arranged to form an increasing sequence. For example, the cards `2, 3, 4` form a run, as do `5, 3, 4`, since they can be re-arranged to form a sequence.

  ### counting

  - each combination of cards that totals to 15 (fifteen): peg 2
  - each pair of cards of the same rank (pair): peg 2
  - each run w/ length GE 3: peg the ame number of points as number of cards in the run
  - if your hand has 4 cards of the same suit (does **not** include the starter) (does **not** apply to the crib?)
  - if your hand contains 4 cards of the same suit (the starter does **not** count, and this does not apply to the crib) (flush): peg 4
  - if your hand contains 4 cards of the same suit as the starter (**does** apply to the crib) (flush of the starter suit): peg 5
  - if your hand contains the jack of the same suit as the starter (his knobs): peg 1
  - **muggins** applies: if you notice another player under-counts their score, you may exclaim "muggins" and claim the points they missed.

## abridged rules (for two players)

Select a dealer for the first round. This dealer then deals six cards to each player. Each player then discards two cards *face down* into a new pile known as the "crib". **The crib is owned by the dealer**, and the crib cards remain face down.

The non-dealer cuts the pack and the dealer reveals the top card of one of the piles - this is the starter. If the starter is a jack, the dealer immediately gets to peg 2 for "his heels".

The non-dealer places a card from their hand face-up on the table, and calls out its rank. The dealer then places a card from their hand, adding it's rank to that of the card on the table and announcing this sum. This continues, alternating between the players and announcing the running sum of all the cards on the table. While this 

The non-dealer and dealer alternate placing cards from their hands onto the table and calling out the running sum of their ranks, and applying the pegging score rules. **The non-dealer places the first card**.
